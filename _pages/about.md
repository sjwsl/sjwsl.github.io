I am a student in the School of Software Engineering at East China Normal University.

My main interests are system programming with C++ and distributed systems.

I am now a GPU architect intern at [NVIDIA](https://NVIDIA.com).

I interned at [Tencent](https://www.tencent.com/) (2020.05 - 2020.07), [Tusimple](https://www.tusimple.com) (2020.07 - 2020.09) and [PingCAP](https://pingcap.com) (2020.10 - 2021.02) as a software engineer.

I expect to be SWE Intern at Google in the summer of 2021.
