I am a student in the School of Software Engineering at East China Normal University.

My main interests and expertise are Linux system programming and distributed systems. 

I usually write code in C++, and occasionally use Python for little tools, Golang for distributed systems and Lisp just for fun. 

I worked for [Tencent](https://www.tencent.com/) (2020.05 - 2020.07), [Tusimple](https://www.tusimple.com) (2020.07 - 2020.09) as a software engineer (intern).

I am an open source enthusiast.
